### Detection of breast cancer in histopathological images of breast cancer with knowledge and color transfer

#### Project description
This is my course conclusion work (TCC) in Information Systems at the Federal University of Cear√°. It addresses the recognition of histopathological images of breast cancer using computer vision techniques.

#### What are histopathological images?

Histopathological images are taken from microscopic biopsy samples, which is a cellular analysis procedure. In recent years, many researchers have fed these images into a database with the aim of encouraging the use of computer vision and image processing techniques to assist medical specialists in the diagnosis of breast cancer. In this project, we use the
Breast Cancer Histopathological Database (BreakHis).
